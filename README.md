### Background

The Japanese-English Bilingual Corpus of Wikipedia's Kyoto Articles” aims mainly at supporting research and development relevant to high-performance multilingual machine translation, information extraction, and other language processing technologies. 


### Unique Features

A precise and large-scale corpus containing about 500,000 pairs of manually-translated sentences.
Can be exploited for research and development of high-performance multilingual machine translation, information extraction, and so on.

The three-step translation process (primary translation -> secondary translation to improve fluency -> final check for technical terms) has been clearly recorded.
Enables observation of how translations have been elaborated so it can be applied for uses such as research and development relevant to translation aids and error analysis of human translation.

Translated articles concern Kyoto and other topics such as traditional Japanese culture, religion, and history.
Can also be utilized for tourist information translation or to create glossaries for travel guides.

The Japanese-English Bilingual Kyoto Lexicon is also available. This lexicon was created by extracting the Japanese-English word pairs from this corpus.
